# SpotifyReleaseBot
This is a Python-based script that checks for new releases by specific artists on Spotify and sends a notification using Discord. The repository integrates the Spotify REST API and a Discord bot for seamless updates.
## Features
- Fetches album releases from Spotify for specified artists.
- Utilizes Spotify's **API** for fetching artist and album details.
- Sends updates about newly released albums or singles via a Discord bot.
- Easy configuration using **JSON** files for artist and bot credentials.

## Requirements
To use this project, you need the following:
- **Python 3.10+**
- `requests` library (pre-installed or added via pip):
``` bash
  pip install requests
```
- A valid Spotify Developer account for API credentials.
- A Discord bot token and permissions to send messages in your server.

## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/spotify-new-release-notifier.git
cd spotify-new-release-notifier
```
### Step 2: Obtain Spotify API Credentials
1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Create a new app and note the **client ID** and **client secret**.

### Step 3: Configure JSON Files
1. Create a `secret.json` file for Spotify credentials:
``` json
    {
      "clientId": "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>",
      "clientSecret": "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
    }
```
1. Create an `artists.json` file to define the artists to monitor:
``` json
    {
      "artistIds": ["<ARTIST_ID_1>", "<ARTIST_ID_2>"]
    }
```
- Replace `<ARTIST_ID>` with the unique Spotify ID of the artists you want to track. You can find these IDs via the Spotify web app by copying the last part of an artistâ€™s profile URL.

### Step 4: Obtain Discord Bot Token and Channel ID
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a bot, and copy the bot token.
2. Add the bot to your server via OAuth2, as described in the guide.
3. Right-click your target channel in Discord, enable Developer Mode, and select **Copy ID** to get the channel ID.

### Step 5: Add Discord Bot Configuration
Update the script to include your bot token and channel ID in the appropriate variables:
- Add these at the start of your Python script:
``` python
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
CHANNEL_ID = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
```
## Running the Script
1. Run the project from the command line:
``` bash
    python main.py
```
1. The script will:
    - Use the Spotify API to check for new releases from the artists in `artists.json`.
    - Send a message to your specified Discord channel if a new release is detected.

## Example Output
When a new release is detected, the bot sends a message in your Discord channel:
``` 
New Release from Ken Carson:
A Great Chaos
album
```
## Troubleshooting
1. **Spotify API Errors**:
    - Ensure your `clientId` and `clientSecret` are correct in `secret.json`.
    - Check if the Spotify access token has expired (you may need to refresh when long sessions are used).

2. **Discord API Errors**:
    - Confirm the bot has permissions to send messages in the target channel.
    - Ensure the `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_ID` values are correct.

3. **General Python Errors**:
    - Missing dependencies can be installed using:
``` bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Syntax issues? Ensure you're running **Python 3.10 or later**.
